How does it Work !!

Trainee ---Aims to be a Master in a field -->Searches for the available Masters in the field-----Selects a Master---->Sends a request

to the master with a quote having the duration of training and fee payment ---Master looks at the details-->Accepts the request---They

will be added to a group with a name-->Master and Trainee uses this group for communication---Master is asked to provide plan--->Plan is

shared in the group---plan would be followed by Master to train trainee---> Here you go !! We are going to have a new Master !!
